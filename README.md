## Getting started

```

Next, run the development server:

```

Finally, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the website.

## Customizing

You can start editing this template by modifying the files in the `/src` folder. The site will auto-update as you edit these files.

### Content Structure

- Documentation pages are created as Markdown files in the `/src/app` directory
- API documentation is powered by OpenAPI specifications in the `/public/api` folder
- The main layout and styling can be customized in the `/src/components` directory

## Features

### Global search

This template includes a global search that's powered by the [FlexSearch](https://github.com/nextapps-de/flexsearch) library. It's available by clicking the search input or by using the `âŒ˜K` shortcut.

This feature requires no configuration, and works out of the box by automatically scanning your documentation pages to build its index. You can adjust the search parameters by editing the `/src/markdoc/search.mjs` file.

### API Documentation

The template includes interactive API documentation with the following features:

- Built with [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) for beautiful documentation rendering
- [Swagger UI](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/) integration for API testing
- Support for multiple API versions with an easy-to-use version selector
- Toggle between "Documentation" and "Try API" modes

To customize the API documentation:
1. Update the OpenAPI specifications in `/public/api` directory
2. Modify the API versions in `/src/app/api-docs/page.tsx`

### Theme Support

The template includes both light and dark theme support using the next-themes library, with automatic detection of system preferences.
